My passion lies in solving complex problems with tailored data and algorithms.I love writing code. Ever since writing my first program in java and manipulating it to produce a desired output, I have been obsessed with the idea of using software to solve practical problem. Software engineering is a never-ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.
